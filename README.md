## Document the Web Scraping Process:
The web scraping process involves extracting data from academic websites such as: https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/organisations/ics-research-centre-for-computational-science-and-mathematical-mo/publications/. The data extracted includes publication titles, authors, abstracts, publication dates, and other metadata. Challenges encountered during web scraping may include handling dynamic content, dealing with pagination, and ensuring compliance with website policies and terms of service.
